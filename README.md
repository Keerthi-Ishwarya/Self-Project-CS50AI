## Projects

### Tic Tac Toe

An AI agent that plays Tic Tac Toe intelligently against the user using the minimax algorithm to determine the optimal moves.

**Highlights:**

- Implements the minimax algorithm to simulate perfect play.
- Ensures a win or draw against any user strategy.

---

### Minesweeper

An AI agent that incorporates knowledge and logic to play Minesweeper intelligently.

**Highlights:**

- Utilizes probability and logical inference to determine safe moves.
- Avoids mines by analyzing the board state.

---

### PageRank

Implementation of the PageRank algorithm using random sampling based on the random surfing model.

**Highlights:**

- Simulates how search engines rank pages.
- Computes the importance of web pages using iterative and probabilistic methods.

---

### Crossword

Modeling and solving crosswords as a constraint satisfaction problem (CSP) using AI techniques.

**Highlights:**

- Leverages the AC3 algorithm for arc consistency.
- Uses backtracking search to find valid crossword solutions.
